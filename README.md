Script: Update Repositories
=============

The intended purpose of this script is to allow developers to come into the office
and run one script that goes through all of their projects and grabs the latest data.

TODO
-------

Here are some things I plan on adding down the road. If you would like to add them,
please submit a topical branch and I will see that it gets into the main line if it rocks!

* Handle branches! Currently it does not play super nice with multiple branches.
* Follow the white rabbit.
